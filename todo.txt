# TODO migration to github
# write about how to run tensorboard
# details on how to run scripts, step-by-step

# TODO PRIMARY
# TODO adaptive learning rate
# TODO realistic noise to df and da:
# TODO    2 soundstreams of [f00,f01,f02,f03] (+) [f10,f11,f12,f13] = [f00, f01, (f02+f10)/2, (f03+f11)/2, f12, f13]
# TODO    according to amount of overlap defined by soundscape_len_by_stream_len
# TODO check gammatone filter under ~/v2a/local/TwoEars-1.4/AuditoryFrontEnd/src/Filters

# TODO TRAINING EXTRA
# TODO add extra 1-hot label to dataset (only uint8 index to dataset, convert to 1-hot np), add extra cost to classify label
# TODO label could be the class of hand gesture for example, so a model learns to differentiate between

# TODO SECONDARY
# TODO what if image drawing could end faster? - image detail dependent sequence length?
# TODO discrete bottleneck
# TODO deterministic warmup
# TODO add embedding visualization: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.1/get_started/embedding_viz
# TODO can go over the original implementation to find bugs if any in the color impl.: https://github.com/ericjang/draw/blob/master/draw.py
# TODO update README.md, rename aev2a.py

what has been already tried:
    # everything (2 soundstream, 20 seqlen) but same dataset
    # everything (2 soundstream, 20 seqlen) and simple dataset
    # everything (3 soundstream, 10 seqlen) and simple dataset
    # everything (2 soundstream, 30 seqlen) and simple dataset and halffs and 16 attn
    # v1 write attention with custom w vector, long sound and 20 seq
    # original write attention
    # wavegan decoder needs update to have more filters in the first conv sweep - doubled, but conv layers became too large
    # mfcss update - done
    # decrease fs to 16k - done
    # full on relu - not better, at least for 12 seq
    # 1 seq with hearing almost converges
    # 16k fs might not be worse than 22k - not conclusive, sound sounds worse
    # try without hearing model/actual sound generation: just pass the low sample audio_gen params raw
    # (8seq-hearing) 10 depth tcn
    # skip connections: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/rnn_cell/ResidualWrapper - under testing
    # longer seq for v1 drawing helps (24 better than 20, 30 better than 24)
    # cw doesn't hurt
    # origi drawer converge better
    # tconly is worse than all three hearing models
    # decreased attention patch reader/writer size for nov1 hearing models doesn't matter
    # v1 seq30 performs slightly better than nov1 seq10 (in general nov1 > v1 w/ same parameters)
    # v1 seq30 > v1 seq24
    # v1 has more difficulty with congruence loss than nov1
    # residual or properreader (20 attention) does not seem to be better for hearing models
    # decrease learning rate: 1e-5 works around the same as 1e-6
    # nonrecurrent performs bad
    # 2 ss at a time is not enough, 3 is needed at least (v1,seq30 with 3 performs better than nov1,seq20 with 2)
    # residual vs nonresidual in nov1 hearing models doesn't matter
    # tanh > lrelu
    # origiwrite performs slightly better with long sounds, and low seqlen
    # >3ss does not make sense unless w/ constant phase
    # added epsilon to sigma, see if this helps in the nan problem --> it's not necessary
    # noised azim works in itself, so it stores information (even after two layers of gaussian noising)
    # overlayed soundstreams are harder to decode by the hearing decoder
    # the higher the dimensionality of the latent variable (different from audio_gen input size), the less guaranteed the perceptual difference between sounds, but more resource to encode complicated visua info
